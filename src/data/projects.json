    "description": "Emsure is a comprehensive insurance management system designed to streamline insurance operations for both agents and customers. The platform provides a user-friendly interface for policy management, claims processing, and customer relationship management. Built with modern web technologies, it offers real-time data synchronization and secure user authentication.",
    "personal-learnings": "I learned that building the Employee Insurance Tracking System taught me how modern tools (React, REST APIs, JWT, MySQL) can solve real issues like delays, fraud, and lack of transparency in health insurance. I saw how Agile practices and user feedback made the system scalable, secure, and user-focused. At the same time, I realized the limits of relying on small surveys, not testing for large-scale use, and working without deep stakeholder engagement. Going forward, I would improve by adding AI, blockchain, mobile access, and better integration tests while involving more stakeholders. Overall, the project showed me how tech can directly support social needs like fair healthcare.",
